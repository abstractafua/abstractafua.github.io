								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/IMG_8832.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									My name is <strong> Afua Frempong </strong>  and I am an aspiring Software Engineer interested in Mobile Development, Database Analysis and Software Development. As a third year computer science major I can't help but feel like the world is my oyster and I'm always hungry to learn more skills and new software. Furthermore as someone who values collaboration and community, my mission is to create and implement ideas that solve significant problems within the world around me. Currently in search of potential Internship opportunities in which I can contribute these skills to an organization with values that align with my mission. In my free time, I like to ride my bike, curate music and create digital designs.
